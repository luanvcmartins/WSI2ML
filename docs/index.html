          <h2>The software and its goals</h2>
          <p>WSI2ML is a straightforward tool for annotating Whole Slide Images (WSIs) for machine learning
            applications. WSIs are high-resolution digital images of entire tissue sections, often used in medical
            research and diagnosis. Annotating these images can be a time-consuming and challenging task, but it is
            critical for training accurate machine learning models.</p>

          <p>The goal of WSI2ML is to streamline the annotation process, making it easy researchers and clinicians to
            label WSIs, and for machine learning specialists to export and use the data for training new machine
            learning applications. The software introduces a task-based approach to annotating data, which simplifies
            the process of training new annotators, tracking their progress and delegating new tasks. These annotations
            can then be used to train machine learning models to accurately diagnose diseases or predict patient
            outcomes.</p>

          <p>Developed as web-application, the software can be installed on a server and made accessible to users in
            your organization. </p>

          <h2 id="installation">Installation</h2>

          <p class="lead">Before you can start annotating your Whole Slide Images (WSIs), you need to install WSI2ML on
            your server.
            This section will guide you through the installation process.</p>

          <div class="row">
            <ol>
              <li>The first step is get the source-code to your server, this can be accomplished by running the
                following GIT command or by simply downloading this repository as a ZIP file.<br>
                <pre><code>git clone https://bitbucket.org/luanvcmartins/img-segmentation.git</code></pre>
              </li>
            </ol>
          </div>


          <h4>Docker image</h4>
          <p>The easiest way to set up the software is using the docker image with docker-compose. Beware you will need
            to properly configure the <code>docker-compose.yml</code> to your environment.</p>
          <p class="alert alert-warning">When creating a new project, the software will require the location of the
            folder containing the source images to be annotated. If you decide to use docker, you will need to mount
            your image folders inside your docker environment.</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Open the <code>docker-compose.yml</code> in your text editor.</li>
            <li>In <code>volumes</code>, mount the folders containing the images for your projects. You can accomplish
              this by reading the docker documentation on mounting folders, but the general idea is to:
            </li>
            <ul>
              <li>To mount the folder <code>/raid/images/</code>, you can input <code> - "/raid/images:/images"</code>
                in the volume section.<br>The images will be available inside docker in a <code>images</code> folder.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <li>In <code>ports</code>, assign the desired port your docker instance will listen, make sure to keep the
              destination folder the same (2000). By default, the software is set up for port 2000.
              <br>For example:
              <ul>
                <li>Use <code>- "80:2000"</code> to host the software on the default 80 port;</li>
                <li>Use <code>- "8080:2000"</code> to host the software on the 8080 port.</li>
              </ul>
            <li>Run the <code>docker-compose</code> to build the image and start the instance:<br>
              <pre><code>
docker-compose build .
docker-compose up -d</code></pre>
            </li>
            <li><b>Test your instance!</b> It should be available on <code>http://localhost:port-used</code> (if you
              didn't change the original port, it will be 2000)
            </li>
          </ol>


          <h2 id="first-use">First use</h2>
          Once you deploy the application, you will use the login information `admin` with the password `admin` to login
          into the system for the first time. We strongly advise you to change the password or delete the user after you
          complete the first setup process.

          <ol>
            <li>Go to the management tab and create a new project: the project's name, WSI folder, and annotation
              labels will be required. The project's description is optional.
            </li>
            <li>Create a new user to delegate your tasks. The user's name, login and password must be provided.
              Additionally, users that require additional feature access may receive additional permissions. Annotators
              need
              no permissions.
            </li>
            <li>Create your first task: select the files for your task on the list and the users to annotate it. An
              optional task name can also be provided.
            </li>
          </ol>

          <h1>Annotating data</h1>
          <p class="lead">In this section we will dive into how to use the software for image annotation and how it
            works for annotators. It's going to be a small tutorial into how to use the system and what the annotation
            process actually looks like. On the next section <i>Management</i>, we provide tutorials on how to set up
            projects, users and tasks.</p>

          <h2 id="task-page">Task page</h2>
          <a class="popup-img" href="assets/images/task-screen.png">
            <img alt="task page" class="img-thumbnail img-fluid" src="assets/images/task-screen.png" style="width: 50%">
          </a>
          <p>Our annotation software offers a personalized user experience with a welcoming page that greets the user
            upon logging in. This page displays the tasks assigned to the user, including annotation and revision
            tasks.</p>

          <p>To help users track their progress, two cards are displayed at the top of the screen, one for annotation
            tasks and one for revision tasks. These cards display the number of remaining images to annotate or review
            and the number of completed tasks, allowing users to easily monitor their progress.</p>

          <p>To continue working on their tasks, users can simply click on the "continue" button on the card to open the
            next image. This button will open the same image until the user flags the task as completed, at which point
            the following image will be opened.</p>

          <p>In addition to the card view, users can access a table displaying all their assignments. This allows users
            to browse and explore all their tasks and images, update their assignments if necessary, and keep track of
            their progress. Our annotation software's user-friendly task screen makes it easy for pathologists and other
            domain-specialists to manage their tasks and maximize their efficiency.</p>

          <h2 id="annotation-screen">Annotation screen</h2>
          <p>Our annotation software features a user-friendly design with a clear division between two main parts of the
            annotation screen. The WSI explorer with its controls occupies the left part of the screen, while the
            control panel containing many options for the tasks is located on the right.</p>

          <p>The WSI explorer provides users with easy-to-use controls for viewing and exploring the WSI file. Users can
            use the mouse button to drag the viewer and the scroll wheel to zoom in or out. Additionally, the viewer's
            center contains controls for exploring the image. On the bottom-left, the annotation toolbox and associated
            tools are available.</p>

          <p>On the right of the viewer, users can access the control panel containing two tabs by default. The first
            tab contains tasks-related options, while the second lists the annotations made. This arrangement helps
            users keep track of their annotations and access task-related options easily.</p>

          <p>Moreover, users can resize the control panel by dragging its edge to fit their screen space and personal
            preference.</p>

          <h2 id="annotating-content">Annotating</h2>
          <p class="alert alert-info"><strong>Anonymization</strong> The software will only provide access to the main
            image inside your WSI file, as such, it's not strictly required to anonymize the images during the
            annotation phase. However, we do recommend you to do so, as not only it's good practice to work with fully
            anonymized images, but it will be easier to allow ML-specialists to use them once the annotation phase is
            over.</p>
          <p>Our software is designed to provide an easy-to-use annotation procedure for domain-specialists, such as
            pathologists. To create new annotations, users can navigate the whole slide image (WSI) file using the
            mouse. Once a region is found for annotation, users can find the annotation tools on the bottom-left of the
            viewer. To create a new annotation, users are expected to select the desired label for the region, which
            defines the color of the annotation, and the tool to select the region. Once the region is delimited, users
            can press ENTER to save the annotation or ESC to cancel the process. While the user uses an annotation tool,
            the image can be dragged by holding down the SPACE key.</p>

          <p>During the annotation drawing phase, a new control appears above the annotation toolbox, which allows users
            to undo or redo changes by sliding the slider back. This feature is particularly useful when using the
            polygon tool to annotate complex shapes. Users have full control to redo steps until a new point is added,
            which removes future steps from the slider.</p>

          <p>It's important to note that only previously registered labels during the project's setup are available to
            be used. This ensures consistency in the labeling process and helps maintain data integrity throughout the
            project. Our software's user-friendly design and intuitive annotation tools help streamline the annotation
            process for pathologists and other domain-specialists by only providing the necessary access to each.
            Project setup are limited to the project's manager with management permissions.</p>

          <h3>Polygon tool</h3>
          <a class="popup-img" href="assets/images/Polygon.gif">
            <img alt="task page" class="img-thumbnail img-fluid" src="assets/images/Polygon.gif" style="width: 50%">
          </a>
          <p>The Polygon tool is a powerful feature in this software that allows users to create annotations with
            complex shapes. With this tool, users can easily create polygons of any shape and size by clicking or
            dragging their mouse.</p>

          <p>To use the Polygon tool, simply select it from the toolbar, select the desired label (color) and click on
            the image to add a single point. Users can then continue to click and add additional points to create a
            polygon with as many sides as desired. Alternatively, users can click and drag their mouse to add points
            along the movement, creating a more fluid shape.</p>

          <p>Once the annotation is drawn, it can be registered in the system by pressing ENTER.</p>

          <h3>Rectangle tool</h3>
          <a class="popup-img" href="assets/images/Rect.gif">
            <img alt="task page" class="img-thumbnail img-fluid" src="assets/images/Rect.gif" style="width: 50%">
          </a>
          <p>The Rect tool is a simple but useful tool for annotating large regions of the same class.
          <p>

          <p>To use the Rect tool, select it from the tools panel, along with the desired label. Once you have selected
            the Rect tool, click and drag from the location where you want one edge of the rectangle to be, to the
            location where you want the opposite edge to be. As you drag, you'll see a preview of the rectangle being
            created.</p>

          <p>Once the annotation is drawn, it can be registered in the system by pressing ENTER.</p>

          <h3>Circle tool</h3>
          <a class="popup-img" href="assets/images/Circle.gif">
            <img alt="task page" class="img-thumbnail img-fluid" src="assets/images/Circle.gif" style="width: 50%">
          </a>
          <p>The Circle tool is a versatile tool for annotating smaller regions of the same class.</p>

          <p>To use the Circle tool, select it from the tools panel. The icon for the Circle tool looks like a circle
            with a dotted outline. Once you have selected the Circle tool, click on the location where you want the
            center of the circle to be. While holding the mouse button down, drag the cursor until the circle fully
            encircles the region you want to annotate. As you drag, you'll see a preview of the circle being created.
          </p>

          <p>Once the region is selected, it can be registered in the system by pressing ENTER.</p>

          <h3>Importing annotations</h3>
          <p>Our software provides a convenient "import annotations" tool that allows users to import previously made
            annotations from other software when annotating new images. To use this feature, users can simply click on
            the "import annotations" button, which is located on the toolbar. Then, they can select the .geojson file
            containing the annotations to be imported.</p>

          <p>Once the file is loaded, the annotations will be displayed to be imported, and users can choose to import
            them individually or all at the same time. To import only some of the annotations, users can click on the
            desired annotation to navigate to its card and press the import button. At this time, users can also change
            the label associated with the annotation. Alternatively, to import all annotations at once, users can click
            the "import all" button on the card.</p>

          <p>If the user is satisfied with the annotations that have been imported, they can cancel the remaining
            annotations by clicking the cancel button on the card. It is important to note that the imported file is
            expected to contain label information. If the label information is not available in the file, the user will
            have to select the labels for each annotation individually. This feature streamlines the annotation process
            and can save users a significant amount of time when working with previously annotated images.</p>


          <h2 id="revising-content">Revising annotations</h2>
          <p>Pathology is a field where the pathologist's experience plays a significant role in the diagnostic process,
            which, in turn, may impact the quality of Machine Learning applications trained with a given dataset.
            Due to the subjective nature of the field, there can be variations in annotations, which may impact the
            quality of the data. To address this issue and improve the quality of annotations, our software provides the
            functionality to revise previous annotations tasks by other users.

          <p>When revising annotations, the user can flag them as correct, incorrect with a wrong label, or incorrect
            with a wrong label and/or region. This information is used when exporting annotations, where the machine
            learning specialist can choose to only export annotations that have been agreed upon by one or more
            revisers. This helps ensure that the exported data is accurate and consistent, which is crucial for the
            development of reliable machine learning models in pathology.</p>

          <p>Revision annotation-tasks are listed in the user's starting page. When selected, the annotation screen
            opens with the annotations to be revised, where the user can navigate through the annotations and provide
            feedback on each one. Once the users feels this task is completed, it can be marked as so.</p>

        <section id="management">
          <h1>Management</h1>
          <p class="lead">In this section we will walk through the process of setting up the software for your
            annotators, managing the projects, and keeping track of the progress.</p>

          <a class="popup-img" href="assets/images/management.png">
            <img alt="task page" class="img-thumbnail img-fluid" src="assets/images/management.png" style="width: 50%">
          </a>

          <p>The software provides special permissions to certain users, referred to as "managers," who have access to
            the Management tab. This tab grants users with "managements" permissions the ability to list, create, edit,
            and remove projects, users, and tasks. In addition to their managerial role, these users may also receive
            annotation or revision tasks as necessary. This feature is designed to provide greater flexibility and
            control to managers who play a key role in the research process.</p>

          <h2 id="manages-projects">Managing projects</h2>
          <p>The software allows users with appropriate permissions to create, edit, and manage projects. A project is a
            way to organize research goals by providing a name, description, and the folder location of the images to be
            annotated. Additionally, a project specifies which labels are included, and each label is identified by a
            unique color. These labels are displayed to the annotators when they open a task belonging to the
            project.</p>

          <p>Managers do not need to assign users to their projects, as the software automatically assigns them when
            they
            receive a task belonging to the project. When editing a project, labels can be changed by clicking on their
            name, modifying them, and then saving the changes. Only the project description is optional when creating a
            new project; all other information is required.</p>

          <h4>Project's folder</h4>
          <p class="alert alert-info">If you use docker, you will need to mount your folders in the container when
            configuring your container build. When creating new projects, you will input the folder's location inside
            the container. </p>
          <p class="alert alert-warning">The software will let you know if you provide an invalid folder location when
            creating a new project or task.</p>

          <p>To effectively use the software for annotating images, it's important to properly set up the project's
            image folder. The software expects users to input the folder path where new images are going to be found.
            This path can be relational to the software working path or absolute. Once this is set up, only images
            inside the designated folder will be available to be chosen when creating a new task for that project.</p>

          <p>To improve organization and ease of use, it's recommended to divide your folder space into projects. This
            way, it will be easier to keep your images organized and ensure that only the relevant images are available
            for each project. Additionally, you can take advantage of Linux's file structure to organize your files
            without needing to physically move them, making it even easier to manage your projects and image
            folders.</p>

          <h2 id="manages-users">Managing users</h2>
          <p>Managers with "manages users" permissions can list, add, and edit users. To register a new user, provide
            their name (full name is accepted), login information (generally first.lastname), a default password, and
            permissions. Annotators don't require any additional permissions. Once a user signs in, they can change
            their password by clicking on their profile in the app bar.</p>

          <h4 id="permissions">Permissions</h4>
          <p>The following permissions are available in the system. Generally, project managers should receive all of
            them, ML-specialists should have <code>Access overview</code> and <code>Can export annotations</code>, while
            domain-specialists
            (annotators) requires no other permission.</p>
          <ol>
            <li><code>Manage users</code>: can create or edit users.</li>
            <li><code>Manage tasks</code>: can create or edit tasks.</li>
            <li><code>Manage projects</code>: can create or edit projects.</li>
            <li><code>Manage apps</code>: can create or edit apps.</li>
            <li><code>Can export annotations</code>: has access to the export tab and can use it to generate annotation
              files to
              train ML models.
            </li>
            <li><code>Access overview</code>: can access the overview tab and keep track of user's progress throughout
              their assigned
              tasks.
            </li>
          </ol>

          <h2 id="manages-tasks">Managing tasks</h2>
          <p>Managers with "manages tasks" permission can create and assign tasks to annotators. When creating a task,
            provide an optional name, the project, task type, and images, along with the users assigned. The interface
            updates with task types, either user annotation or revision, when a project is selected. To
            create a user task, select files to annotate, which will combine all images into a single task. To create
            a revision task, select a previously completed task based on name, date, or files and choose annotators to
            be revised.</p>
          <p>Batch task creation is also available, where a task name, project, and image folder are provided. The
            intersection control allows for dividing tasks among annotators, with an option to control how many people
            should annotate each slide. This control can be set to assign all annotators to each image or equally divide
            slides among annotators.</p>
          <p>For example, if you want many perspectives on the same file, you can make two or more annotators work on
            the
            same image. As
            such, for instance, if you have 4 annotators, and you want all of them to annotate each image, you select
            the
            intersection level 4. However, if you want to equally divide slides, you can choose the intersection
            level 1, which will assign each image only one time to the annotators.</p>

          <p>Users with the access overview can track progress on the "overview tab".</p>

          <h1>Exporting data</h1>
          <p class="lead">In this section we will explain to generate a version of the dataset and how to employ it to
            use in machine learning tasks.</p>

          <a class="popup-img" href="assets/images/export.png">

          <h2 id="exporting-screen">Exporting screen</h2>
          <p>Users with the "can export annotations" permission can utilize the Export tab to access all available
            projects in the software. To export annotations, users can select a project, which opens the project's
            export form. There are two options for exporting annotations: exporting annotations for each task
            individually or exporting all data.</p>

          <p>The user have the option select the annotations to be exported per task individually. In this context, the
            user can select one of the annotators who completed the task to export its annotation for those slides. When
            an annotator is selected, the system will query available revising options, if anyone revised that
            annotation task. The users have the additional option to chose one or more reviewers to filter out dubious
            annotations from the dataset.</p>

          <p>The software also provides the options to export all data in a much easier approach. The user can select
            which annotators they want to export the data and which reviewers they want to filter out annotations. This
            will automatically select all possible tasks for exporting.</p>

          <p class="alert alert-info">Annotations are only eligible to be exported if all selected reviewers agree that
            it is correct or if they agree on the correction. If that happens, the corrected version is exported. The
            user also has the option to not export annotations that have not been revised.</p>

          <p>Once the user is satisfied with the export options, they can click the export button to start the process,
            and the output will be a zip file containing .geojson files for each slide/image annotated. The process can
            take a while to complete depending on the amount of annotations, however, the user will be notified of its
            progress.
          </p>

          <p>The .geojson files contain both the annotation geometry and metadata, allowing for customization of
            analysis. The software was designed to be non-opinionated in regard to machine learning tasks and
            approaches employed by the user, so the geojson format allows for a wide range of machine learning
            applications to be developed. For example, the same dataset can be used with the <code>shapely</code>
            library to extract
            tiles in a classical CNN-based classification setting or use the geometry for novel graph-based
            approaches.</p>
